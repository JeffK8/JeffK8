- 👋 Hi, I’m @JeffK8
- 👀 I’m interested in Smart Home Automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to setup Raspberry-Pi and also learn various languages to control it.
- 💞️ I’m not really ready to collaborate on projects until I come up to speed; currently looking at automating our vertical blinds, so much to learn on the mechanical and software side. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... my email is jkarr@att.net and I review it as I get time every few days.
